Okay, so Haseeb here. We need to get the ScandicTech website updated by Friday. Zax, you need to look at the lead generation script and make sure it doesn't crash on Swedish characters. Oh, and Sarah, please send the invoice to the Danish client by tomorrow morning. We also discussed the new office coffee machine, but that's low priority. Let's meet again on Monday. Zax, also make sure you email me the CV by tonight.
